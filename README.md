One of the standout features of RealTimeFeed is its implementation of real-time functionality, enabling a dynamic global feed that instantaneously updates as users submit, delete, or modify posts. This real-time aspect enhances the user experience by fostering a dynamic and interactive environment where users can actively participate in the ongoing conversation and stay updated with the latest content changes. Overall, RealTimeFeed is designed to provide a modern and engaging social platform, making it easier for users to connect, share, and stay informed in real-time.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

Before running the RealTimeFeed project on your local machine, ensure that you have the following software and dependencies installed:

1. **Node.js and npm**: RealTimeFeed relies on Node.js for server-side execution and npm (Node Package Manager) for managing project dependencies. Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/.

2. **MongoDB**: The project utilizes MongoDB as its database. Install MongoDB by following the instructions provided at https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community.

3. **React and TailwindCSS**: RealTimeFeed's frontend is built using React and styled with TailwindCSS. Install React and TailwindCSS globally using the following commands:

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
RealTimeFeed is currently deployed on Vercel and can be accessed at https://realtimefeed-frontend.vercel.app/. To deploy the project on your own live system, follow these additional notes:

1. **Vercel Account**: Ensure you have an account on Vercel (https://vercel.com/).

2. **Configure Project**: Set up your Vercel project by connecting it to your version control system (e.g., GitHub). This allows Vercel to automatically deploy changes when you push updates to your repository.

3. **Environment** Variables: Set up environment variables in your Vercel project dashboard to match those used in the RealTimeFeed project. These variables may include database connection strings, API keys, and other sensitive information.

4. **Deploy**: Trigger a manual deployment or allow Vercel to automatically deploy your project based on the configured settings. Vercel will handle the build and deployment process for both the frontend and backend.

4. **Access Live System**: Once the deployment process is complete, you can access your live RealTimeFeed system using the provided Vercel domain or a custom domain if configured.
